Package rh-nodejs8 provides Node.js platform delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the rh-nodejs8 collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working Node.js platform.

Usage: scl enable rh-nodejs8 'node'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is /opt/rh/rh-nodejs8/root
in case of the rh-nodejs8 collection.

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

When you want to work with the rh-nodejs8 collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable rh-nodejs8 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the rh-nodejs8
  software collections environment.

scl enable rh-nodejs8 'node'
  Run node from the rh-nodejs8 software collection.

scl enable rh-nodejs8 bash
  Run an interactive shell with the rh-nodejs8 software collection enabled.

scl enable rh-nodejs8 'man node'
  Show man pages for the node command, which is a part of the
  rh-nodejs8 software collection.
