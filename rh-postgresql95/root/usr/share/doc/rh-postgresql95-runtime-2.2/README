Package rh-postgresql95 provides PostgreSQL database management system delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the rh-postgresql95 collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working PostgreSQL database management system.

Usage: scl enable rh-postgresql95 'psql'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is /opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/root
in case of the rh-postgresql95 collection.

PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS).
The postgresql-server package contains the programs needed to create
and run a PostgreSQL server, which will in turn allow you to create
and maintain PostgreSQL databases.

When you want to work with the rh-postgresql95 collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Configuration for the rh-postgresql95 software collection is located
under /etc/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95.

Examples:
scl enable rh-postgresql95 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the rh-postgresql95
  software collections environment.

scl enable rh-postgresql95 'psql'
  Run psql from the rh-postgresql95 software collection.

scl enable rh-postgresql95 bash
  Run an interactive shell with the rh-postgresql95 software collection enabled.

scl enable rh-postgresql95 'man psql'
