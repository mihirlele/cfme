.SH NAME
postgresql-setup \- manual page for postgresql-setup 6.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B postgresql-setup
\fIMODE_OPTION \fR[\fI--unit=UNIT_NAME\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Script is aimed to help sysadmin with basic database cluster administration.
Usually, "postgresql\-setup \fB\-\-initdb\fR" and "postgresql\-setup \fB\-\-upgrade\fR" is
enough, however there are other options described below.
.PP
For more info and howto/when use this script please look at the documentation
file \fI/opt/rh/rh\-postgresql95/root/usr/share/doc/rh\-postgresql95\-postgresql/README.rpm\-dist\fP.
.SS "Available operation mode:"
.TP
\fB\-\-initdb\fR
Initialize new PostgreSQL database cluster.  This is usually the
first action you perform after PostgreSQL server installation.
.TP
\fB\-\-upgrade\fR
Upgrade database cluster for new major version of PostgreSQL
server.  See the \fB\-\-upgrade\-from\fR option for more info.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-unit\fR=\fIUNIT_NAME\fR
The UNIT_NAME is used to select proper unit
configuration (unit == service or initscript name
on non\-systemd systems).  For example, if you want
to work with unit called
\&'postgresql@com_example.service', you should use
\&'postgresql@com_example' (without trailing .service
string).  When no UNIT_NAME is explicitly passed,
the 'postgresql' string is used by default.
.TP
\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
port where the initialized server will listen for
connections
.TP
\fB\-\-new\-systemd\-unit\fR
We dropped this option for security reasons.
Nowadays, please use the root\-only script
\fI/opt/rh/rh\-postgresql95/root/usr/sbin/postgresql\-new\-systemd\-unit\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
Dropped with \fB\-\-new\-systemd\-unit\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-upgrade\-from\-unit\fR=\fIUNIT\fR
Select proper unit name to upgrade from.  This
has similar semantics as \fB\-\-unit\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-upgrade\-ids\fR
Print list of available IDs of upgrade scenarios to
standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-upgrade\-from\fR=\fIID\fR
Specify id "old" postgresql stack to upgrade
from.  List of available IDs can be listed by
\fB\-\-upgrade\-ids\fR.  Default is 'postgresql'.
.SS "Other options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
show this help
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show version of this package
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
show basic debugging information
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS
Options carried by this variable are passed to
subsequent call of `initdb` binary (see man
initdb(1)).  This variable is used also during
\&'upgrade' mode because the new cluster is actually
re\-initialized from the old one.
.TP
PGSETUP_PGUPGRADE_OPTIONS
Options in this variable are passed next to the
subsequent call of `pg_upgrade`.  For more info
about possible options please look at man
pg_upgrade(1).
.TP
PGSETUP_DEBUG
Set to '1' if you want to see very verbose shell
debugging output.
.PP
Built against PostgreSQL version 9.5.14.
