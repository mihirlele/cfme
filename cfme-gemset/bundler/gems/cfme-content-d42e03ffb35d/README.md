Default ManageIQ content.

At present, this repo contains only the ManageIQ automate domain.  In the future,
more content will be extracted from the ManageIQ/manageiq repo such as dialogs,
reports, and policies.

## Contributing

First, you will need to set up your repo for development.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Set up the ManageIQ application in the spec/manageiq directory.  This can be
   done in one of two ways.
   - Run `bin/setup`.  This command will do a shallow clone of ManageIQ into spec/manageiq,
     and also prepare any files for setup.
   - Create a symlink from spec/manageiq to a local source checkout of ManageIQ.
     This is especially useful if you will be modifying ManageIQ itself at the
     same time.
3. `bundle`
4. `bundle exec rake spec:setup`

Now you are ready to begin development.  You can run the specs with
`bundle exec rake`.

Please be sure to add specs for any new automate methods you create, and follow
the [ManageIQ development guidelines](https://github.com/ManageIQ/guides/blob/master/coding_style_and_standards.md).
Thanks for your contribution!
